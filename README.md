# Airline-Customer-Value-Analysis

Airline Customer Value Analysis is the last project for Unsupervised Learning, Data Science Bootcamp at Rakamin Academy. I and 6 other collaborators worked together. We created predictive model using K-Means Clustering and cross-validation evaluation using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that generated 3 classes. We also gave business recommendation for each class to increase customer retention and airline sales, like:


## Project Background
   In this stage, we need to understanding the details about the dataset, problem statement, goal, objective and business metrics of our project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Business Insight
        - Descriptive Statistics
        - Checking Duplicated Data
        - Checking Missing Value
        - KDE Plot
        - Checking Correlation

## Data Preprocessing
        - Handling Duplicated Data
        - Handling Outlier
        - Feature Selection for Clustering
        - Standardization

## Modelling
        - Model Evaluation with Elbow Method
        - K-means Clustering
        - Visualization with PCA

## Business Recomendation
        - We recommend being given a promo in the form of cash back or cashback attractive vouchers so they can come back to do transaction. This is because the cost to retain customers is 5-25 times cheaper than finding new customers
        - We recommend the accumulation of points from each flight what the customer did for one year, then the customer with the points highest (customer Important) will be given a prize draw. It is aim to keep them loyal.
