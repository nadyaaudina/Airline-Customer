# Airline-Customer-Value-Analysis

Airline Customer Value Analysis is the last project for Unsupervised Learning, Data Science Bootcamp at Rakamin Academy. I and 6 other collaborators worked together We chose to use the RFM method in making customer segmentation. This is because the RFM method is one of the customer segmentation method which is quite often used in industry. 


We gathered dataset from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/used-car-auction-prices). Our project workflow consists of 4 stages, you can see a summary below: Rakamin Data Science Bootcamp Final Project.

## Project Background
   In this stage, we need to understanding the details about the dataset, problem statement, goal, objective and business metrics of our project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Business Insight
        - Descriptive Statistics
        - Checking Duplicated Data
        - Checking Missing Value
        - KDE Plot
        - Checking Correlation

## Data Preprocessing
        - Handling Duplicated Data
        - Handling Outlier
        - Feature Selection for Clustering
        - Standardization

## Modelling
        - Model Evaluation with Elbow Method
        - K-means Clustering
        - Visualization with PCA

## Business Recomendation
        - We recommend being given a promo in the form of cash back or cashback attractive vouchers so they can come back to do transaction. This is because the cost to retain customers is 5-25 times cheaper than finding new customers
        - We recommend the accumulation of points from each flight what the customer did for one year, then the customer with the points highest (customer Important) will be given a prize draw. It is aim to keep them loyal.
